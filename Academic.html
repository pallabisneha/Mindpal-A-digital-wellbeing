                Academic stress often arises from deadlines, exams, or managing multiple assignments. These exercises can help students manage workload effectively while staying focused and calm.

                Pomodoro Technique:
                The Pomodoro technique breaks work into manageable intervals. The cycle consists of working for 25 minutes (called a "Pomodoro") followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes). This method improves concentration, reduces burnout, and helps with time management.
                Steps:
                
                Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on a single task.
                After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break.
                Repeat the cycle four times, then take a longer break.
                Visualization Exercise:
                Visualization involves mentally rehearsing the successful completion of an academic task, which can reduce anxiety and improve performance.
                Steps:
                
                Close your eyes and visualize completing the task step by step.
                Imagine how you’ll feel once it's done, and focus on positive outcomes.
                Use this technique before studying, taking exams, or presenting.
