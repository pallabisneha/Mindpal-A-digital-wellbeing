                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>1. Create a Study Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Design a realistic study timetable that fits your daily routine. Allocate time for each subject.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>2. Choose the Right Study Environment</h3>
                    <p>Pick a quiet and well-lit space to study. Keep distractions away by turning off phone notifications.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>3. Gather All Necessary Materials</h3>
                    <p>Before starting, collect all books, notes, and supplies so you can stay focused without interruptions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>4. Organize Your Workspace</h3>
                    <p>Keep your study area neat and tidy. A clutter-free space encourages focus and productivity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>5. Take Breaks Regularly</h3>
                    <p>Work for 25-50 minutes, then take short breaks. This keeps your mind fresh and helps retention.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>6. Set Clear Goal</h3>
                    <p>Begin each study session with specific objectives to stay focused. Clearly defined goals help you track your progress and stay motivated.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>7. Prioritize Tasks </h3>
                    <p>Focus on the most important and challenging tasks first. Tackling difficult subjects when your energy levels are high can improve understanding and retention.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>8. Practice Retrieval</h3>
                    <p>Test yourself regularly on the material to reinforce learning. Self-quizzing helps you identify gaps in your knowledge.

            <h2>Effective Study Strategies</h2>
            <div class="tips-container">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>1. Use Active Recall</h3>
                    <p>Test yourself frequently on the material you study instead of re-reading, which improves memory retention.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>2. Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Review your notes at increasing intervals. This method helps store information in long-term memory.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>3. Teach Someone Else</h3>
                    <p>Explaining the topic to a peer or even to yourself can clarify complex concepts and reinforce learning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>4. Focus on Understanding, Not Memorizing</h3>
                    <p>Make sure you understand the material. Understanding leads to better retention than simple rote memorization.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>5. Stay Consistent</h3>
                    <p>Studying a little every day is better than cramming the night before. Consistency improves knowledge retention.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>6. Break Down Large Tasks</h3>
                    <p>Divide complex topics into smaller, manageable parts. Tackling one small part at a time makes studying less overwhelming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>7. Stay Hydrated and Eat Well</h3>
                    <p>Proper nutrition and hydration boost brain function and help maintain focus during study sessions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>8. Get Adequate Sleep</h3>
                    <p>Ensure you get enough rest to consolidate information. Sleep is essential for memory retention and cognitive function. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.
